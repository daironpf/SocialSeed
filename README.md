# Social Seed - Build Your Own Social Network with Spring Boot, Neo4j, and Hexagonal Architecture

Welcome to **Social Seed**, an open-source foundation for building customizable and scalable social networks.

The backend is powered by **Spring Boot** in a **hexagonal architecture** and **Neo4j** as the graph database. On top of that, we are releasing a **Flutter mobile app on Google Play Store** that lets users connect to and switch between multiple Social Seed-based social networks ‚Äî offering a new and flexible way to interact with online communities.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Flutter app is available only as a published product on the Play Store. Its source code is not part of this repository.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Social Seed equips developers with the tools to create their own social network:

* **Backend:** Spring Boot + Hexagonal Architecture for clean and scalable design.
* **Database:** Neo4j to power relationships and graph-based features.
* **Mobile App (Play Store):** A native Flutter application (distributed via Google Play) to explore, join, and switch across networks built on Social Seed.

Whether you want to build a **niche community**, a **private network**, or a **large-scale social hub**, Social Seed gives you the foundation to make it happen.
